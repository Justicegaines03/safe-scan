# SafeScan Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the test suite created for the SafeScan QR code security application. The test suite is designed to guide development and ensure robust functionality across all planned features.

## Test File Structure

### 6. **Performance.test.ts**
**Purpose**: Performance benchmarks, load testing, and resource optimization

**Key Test Categories**:
- Scan Performance (processing times, batch operations)
- Memory Performance (usage tracking, cleanup efficiency)
- Network Performance (API response times, caching)
- UI Performance (rendering, debouncing, virtual scrolling)
- Battery and Resource Usage (optimization strategies)

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install additional testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev @react-native-async-storage/async-storage expo-camera
```

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests for CI/CD (no watch, with coverage)
npm run test:ci

# Run specific test file
npm test CameraScanner.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="QR Code Detection"
```

### Configuration Files

**jest.config.js**: Main Jest configuration
- Sets up test environment for React Native/Expo
- Configures module transformations and mocking
- Sets coverage collection and reporting

**jest.setup.js**: Test setup and global mocks
- Mocks Expo modules (camera, linking, haptics)
- Sets up AsyncStorage mocking
- Configures global test utilities

## Development Workflow

### 1. **Test-Driven Development Approach**
1. **Start with failing tests**: Write tests for features before implementing them
2. **Implement minimal functionality**: Make tests pass with minimal code
3. **Refactor and optimize**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Add edge cases**: Expand tests to cover more scenarios

### 2. **Feature Development Guide**
For each new feature:
1. Review relevant test file to understand requirements
2. Run tests to see current failures
3. Implement feature incrementally
4. Ensure all tests pass before moving to next feature

### 3. **Testing Best Practices**
- **Use descriptive test names**: Tests should clearly describe what they're testing
- **Test behavior, not implementation**: Focus on what the code should do, not how
- **Keep tests isolated**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
- **Mock external dependencies**: Use mocks for APIs, camera, storage, etc.
- **Test edge cases**: Include unusual inputs, error conditions, and boundary cases

## Expected Test Failures During Development

Since these tests are written before implementation, expect many failures initially:

### Initial State (Before Implementation)
- All tests will fail because services and components don't exist yet
- TypeScript compilation errors due to missing types and interfaces
- Missing mock implementations for external services

### During Development
- Tests will gradually pass as features are implemented
- Some tests may need adjustment as implementation details become clear
- Performance tests may need baseline adjustments

### Fully Implemented State
- All tests should pass
- Coverage should be >90% for critical paths
- Performance tests should meet established benchmarks

## Continuous Integration Setup

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Test SafeScan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:ci
      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          file: ./coverage/lcov.info
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### TypeScript Errors
- **Mock type issues**: Update mock types to match actual interfaces
- **Missing dependencies**: Install @types packages for better type support
- **Jest configuration**: Ensure Jest is properly configured for TypeScript

### Test Environment Issues
- **Module resolution**: Check Jest moduleNameMapping in configuration
- **Expo modules**: Ensure Expo modules are properly mocked in jest.setup.js
- **React Native components**: Use appropriate test renderers for RN components

### Performance Test Issues
- **Timing sensitivity**: Performance tests may be environment-dependent
- **Memory measurements**: Node.js memory APIs may not be available in all environments
- **Async operations**: Ensure proper handling of promises and timeouts

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Categories to Consider
1. **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader compatibility, color contrast
2. **Internationalization Testing**: Multi-language support, RTL layouts
3. **Security Testing**: Input validation, data encryption
4. **Platform-Specific Testing**: iOS vs Android behavior differences
5. **Regression Testing**: Automated tests for previously fixed bugs

### Test Automation
1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Screenshot comparison for UI changes
2. **Device Testing**: Automated testing on multiple device configurations
3. **Load Testing**: Stress testing with high volumes of scans
4. **User Journey Testing**: Automated end-to-end user scenarios

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite provides a solid foundation for developing the SafeScan application. By following the test-driven development approach outlined here, you can ensure that your implementation meets all requirements and handles edge cases gracefully.

The tests serve as both specification and validation, guiding you through the development process while ensuring code quality and reliability. As you implement each feature, use the corresponding test file to understand the expected behavior and verify your implementation.

Remember to run tests frequently during development and update them as needed when requirements change or new edge cases are discovered.
