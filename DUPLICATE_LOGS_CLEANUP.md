# Duplicate Logs Cleanup - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The app was creating duplicate history entries for a single QR code scan. When a user deleted all scans and imported mock scans, the first real scan was assigned ID 18 instead of the expected ID 16, indicating that duplicate entries were being created.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was found in the `handleQRCodeScanned` function in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`. The problem was a **race condition** where:

1. The camera's barcode scanner fires multiple detection events in rapid succession (within milliseconds)
2. React state updates (`setIsScanning(false)`) are asynchronous 
3. Multiple scan events would pass the `isScanning` check before the state actually updated
4. This resulted in the same QR code being processed multiple times simultaneously
5. Each processing created a separate history entry, leading to duplicates

## Solution Implemented
Added an **immediate synchronous flag** using React `useRef` to prevent race conditions:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added immediate processing flag:**
   ```tsx
   const isProcessing = useRef(false); // Immediate flag to prevent duplicate processing
   ```

2. **Updated `handleQRCodeScanned` function:**
   - Added immediate check: `if (isProcessing.current) return;`
   - Set flag before processing: `isProcessing.current = true;`
   - Clear flag in `finally` block: `isProcessing.current = false;`
   - Added console logging for duplicate detection

3. **Updated `resetScanner` function:**
   - Reset processing flag: `isProcessing.current = false;`

4. **Fixed missing dependencies:**
   - Uncommented `STORAGE_KEY` and `getHistoryFromStorage` function
   - Added missing `showManualInput` state variable

## How the Fix Works
- The `useRef` flag provides **immediate synchronous access** that bypasses React's async state updates
- When the first scan event starts processing, the flag is immediately set to `true`
- Any subsequent scan events (duplicates) are immediately rejected with a console log
- The flag is cleared when processing completes (success or error)
- This prevents multiple simultaneous processing of the same QR code

## Expected Results
- Single QR code scan should now create only one history entry
- Console logs should show "Already processing a scan, ignoring duplicate" for any duplicate events
- History IDs should increment properly (16, 17, 18, etc.) without gaps
- No more redundant VirusTotal API calls or community rating lookups

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Fixed duplicate scan processing race condition

## Testing Recommendations
1. Clear all history and import mock scans
2. Scan a QR code and verify only one entry is created with ID 16
3. Scan additional codes and verify sequential ID assignment
4. Monitor console logs for duplicate detection messages
